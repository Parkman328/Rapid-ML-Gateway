Qlik Rapid Api Gateway(QRAG) is an open source Python implementation of Qlik SSE that simplifies bi-directional data exchange between Qlik Application and API based data sources.
The intial use case was to allow Qlik to use AI/ML functions and interact with other executions engines. The system utilizes GRPC messaging from Qlik and currently in the inital release support REST, Websocket APIs.

Integration Use Cases are Following

- Integration with Open API Calls
- Interacting with Qlik Data on Third Party APIs
- Training ML Models with Qlik Data
- Scoring Qlik Data against ML Models
- Integration to AWS Sagemaker
- Integration to R
- Integration to Python

The system is built around quickly **using qrag.ini and functions.json** to send request and **add results back into QIX engine**. It's goal is to help Qlik users integrate into API/Microservices Architecture.

**Note: QRAG is in the ALPHA TESTING PHASE.** Core functionality is complete, please let Qlik Partner Engineering Team know if you run into any data, compatibility or install issues! Thank you for [reporting any BUGS in the issue tracking system here](https://github.com/Qlik-PE/Qlik-Rapid-API-Gateway/issues), and We welcome your feedback and questions on usage/features.

**Things that may happen if there is Qlik developer/Customer demand.**

- Office Hours
- Installation Videos
- Use Case Videos
- UI for Configuration rather than Configuration of Ini files

For Initial Release our target is support AWS Sagemaker Platform.
Please take a look at Readme inside Sagemaker folder

## Using Docker

Please pull from Docker hub from Partner Engineering Organization  
[Qlik Partner Engineering Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/qlikpe/qrag)  
[Qlik PE QRAG Realse Notes](https://github.com/Qlik-PE/Qlik-Rapid-API-Gateway/blob/master/docker/README.md)  
#For Sample Test Please run (Please note Sagemaker Service is turned on and it is recommended you only turn on signle module for each Container for Production Use Case)
`docker run -d -p 50057:50057  --name qrag4 qlikpe/qrag:latest`

# Basic Usage

1. Install QRAG on Qlik Server/ Remote Server
2. Define functions in functions.json
3. Define QRAG setting in QRAG.ini
4. Restart Qlik Engine

# Contribute

This is Qlik Partner Engineering Sponsored open-source project!  I ([John Park](john.park@qlik.com )) built it to be the most useful tool possible and take frustration out of writing SSEs. I also want to have all partner tools compatible with QRAG. If you have a toolset that you want to build compatibility with please let us know we can setup a folder and you can commit your code.

### 1. Spread the word !

A STAR here on GitHub(https://github.com/Qlik-PE/Qlik-Rapid-API-Gateway), and a mention on Twitter or Instagram @qlik and blog post are the easiest contribution and can potentially help grow this project tremendously!

Medium articles, YouTube video tutorials and other content take more time but will help all the more!

### 2. Report bugs & issues

I expect there to be many quirks once the project is used by more and more people with a variety of new (& "unclean") data. If you found a bug, please [open a new issue here](https://github.com/Qlik-PE/Qlik-Rapid-API-Gateway/issues).  Please change logging level to "DEBUG" and upload log files/snippets.

### 3. Suggest and discuss usage/features

To make QRAG as useful as possible we need to hear what you would like it to do, or what it could do better! [Head over to Github Wiki to Place Feature/Request](https://github.com/Qlik-PE/Qlik-Rapid-API-Gateway/issues).

### 4. Contribute to the development

We definitely welcome the help I can get on this project, simply get in touch on the issue tracker.

### 5. Bug Fixes and Pull Requests

There will be a monthly Pull Requests Merge done. Please stay tuned.
